# Docker

Common images used for my projects.

These are images that are used for [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and slimmed by [SlimToolkit](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim).

## Images

Each of the images are separated by the folders in the project.

## Compose

We have a docker-compose configuration that manages all the dependencies used by my projects.
