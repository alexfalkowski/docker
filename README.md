# Docker

Common images used for my projects.

These are images that are used for [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/). They have docker compose so we can run what is locally setup.

## Images

Each of the images are separated by the folders in the project.

## Compose

We have a docker compose configuration that manages all the dependencies used by my projects.
